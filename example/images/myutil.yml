# This group member image metadata describes a image which builds on the myutil-base image:
#    *review myutil-base.yml  before reading this*
# How we should find a Dockerfile in a GitHub repo and build it for an OCP release.

# Information about the dist-git repo
distgit:
  namespace: containers   # default is "containers", but can be set to "apbs" for new dist-git repo type
  # Component specifies the Bugzilla components associated with this image. It defaults to
  # the name of the distgit repo.
  ## component: myutil

# The image name the Dockerfile builds. In this example, the image would land
# in registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/my-util:vX.Y.Z once shipped.
name: openshift3/myutil

# This section defines how the FROM field in the upstream Dockerfile will be set
# before each build.
from:
  # Use "member" if another member of the group defines the base image for this Dockerfile.
  member: myutil-base   # From a member of the group

  # Use stream to indicate one of the streams defined in streams.yml. Generally, this would be
  # "rhel" for OCP images. It is called a "stream" because this is not a fixed version of rhel,
  # but will change to over time as new versions of RHEL are released or CVEs are fixed.
  ## stream: rhel

  # Use "image" if a literal image and tag should be injected into the FROM field of the Dockerile.
  # This is uncommon and doozer will not attempt to change the specified literal string to, for example,
  # pick up new CVEs in the base image.
  ## image: namespace/imagename:tag

  # Use "builder" for multistage builds to specify the builder image(s) in addition to the base image.
  # This is an array where each member has the above properties available.
  # The entries must be in the same order as the FROMs in the Dockerfile.
  ## builder:
  ## - member: myutl-builder
  ## - image: namespace/imagename:tag
  ## - stream: rhel

# rpm group members on which this image is reliant (rpm will always be built before image)
rpms:
  - myutil

# Owners are emailed when the build process notes the upstream Dockerfile has
# changed and needs to be "reconciled" with what is in distgit. Eventually, owners
# may also be notified if their image / RPM is causing the build to fail.
owners:
  - email@redhat.com
  - email2@redhat.com

# Labels that will be set into the Dockerfile. name, version, and release will be set automatically.
# com.redhat.component  will default to the dist-git repo name (containers/openshift-enterprise-node).

# This section describes:
# (1) where to find the upstream Dockerfile for this image.
# (2) Fine-grained changes that need to be made to the upstream Dockerfile in order for it to build for OCP.
content:

  # Where to pull the upstream Dockerfile from. Source locations are defined by an "alias" which is a logical
  # name for a git repository. Source aliases must be defined in group.yml or specified on the command line
  # by the build process. In the following example, doozer will use the following file for its upstream source Dockerfile:
  # [cloned ose repo root]/images/node/Dockerfile.rhel7
  source:
    # If the source has an alias defined, an extracted local directory can be specified on the local file system
    # using --source alias path.
    # alias: enterprise-images-upstream-example # DEPRECATED
    git: # source content to use for this rpm
      url: git@github.com:OpenShiftART/image-upstream-example.git
      branch:
        target: release-3.8
        # Fallback branch is used if release-3.8 does not exist yet
        fallback: master
    # Specify the path in the upstream repo to use as build context (default: top of the repo)
    # If a build does not require the entire source tree then use a subdirectory as the container build context.
    path: images/myutil
    # Optionally specify non-default upstream Dockerfile (within and relative to path)
    dockerfile: Dockerfile.rhel7
    ##dockerfile: image/myutil/Dockerfile.rhel7

# if set true means this image is included in payload, false means it's a non-payload image
# mandatory for all the images. 
for_payload: false

# Images can specify they would like to be pushed to a completely different
# registry/namesapce/repo during default pushes.
push:
  # A list of names that will be used when pushing to registries without ns/repo. If
  # not specified, default to 'name:' field.
  repos:
    - openshift3/myutil
    - another_ns/another-repo
  also:
    # Additional full registry/ns/repos to push to.

# Generally doozer scan-sources will detect all possible change factors automatically and trigger rebuilds.
# However, certain images may consume RPMs in unexpected way that make it programmatically impossible to 
# detect they were used.
