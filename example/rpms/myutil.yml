# This group member metadata describes how we should find an RPM described
# in a GitHub repo, build it, and make it available for an image group
# member to consume.

# Config mode: enabled | disabled | wip
# Leaving this out entirely means `enable` which is normal operation
mode: wip  # new configs default to Work In Progress mode

# Eventually, owners may also be notified if their RPM is causing the overall build to fail.

  # Describes where *.spec for this RPM can be found.
  # Where to pull the upstream spec file from. Source locations are defined by an "alias" which is a logical
  # name for a git repository. Source aliases must be defined in group.yml or specified on the command line
  # by the build process. In the following example, doozer will use the following file for its upstream source spec file:
  # [cloned ose repo root]/myutil.spec
  source:
    # alias: enterprise-images-upstream-example # DEPRECATED
    git: # source content to use for this rpm
      url: git@github.com:OpenShiftART/image-upstream-example.git
      branch:
        target: release-3.8
        # Fallback branch is used if release-3.8 does not exist yet
        fallback: master
    # The path within the git repository to find *.spec (defaults to root of repo)
    ## path: images/node
    # Only specify if there are more than one spec files int the path.
    ## specfile: myutil.spec

# Name of RPM package being built
