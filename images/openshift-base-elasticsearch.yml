  # what we really want is the latest build of this package, which is a freshmaker
  # build. freshmaker builds don't get a useful tag like "latest" or "5.6.16"
  # so the old update-base-images implementation used to look up the tag from brew.
  # doozer can't do that; this could get an updated freshmaker build at some
  # point, in which case we might need to move to that. but it seems unlikely.
