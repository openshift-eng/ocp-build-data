# Generally doozer scan-sources will detect all possible change factors automatically and trigger rebuilds.
# However, certain images may consume RPMs in unexpected way that make it programmatically impossible to
# detect they were used.
scan_sources:
  # The openstack-16-for-rhel-8-rpms repo provides some python3-* packages newer than those from rhel-8-baseos-rpms.
  # For some reason this image doesn't consume those newer versions.
