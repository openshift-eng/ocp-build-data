      # The OpenShift 4.x:base image used by numerous images in CI.
      # The problem is that the actual image is built upstream very infrequently
      # (very few changes are made to the openshift/images repo).
      # So the "normal" CI promotion logic that updates 4.x:base almost never runs.
      # This means that the 4.x:base image diverges over time from the UBI content
      # that ART is constantly updating its images with. We want 4.x:base to be
      # very similar to what we are using downstream so that CI signal represents
      # the downstream product.

      # The upstream_image_base serves as a starting point for the upstream_image.
      # ART will mirror the brew build out to upstream_image_base.
      # ART does not mirror the upstream_image in this case. A buildconfig,
      # generated by images:streams is triggered when upstream_image_base is updated.
      # The output of this buildconfig is upstream_image.
      # This buildconfig layers on files necessary for the resulting upstream_image CI image
      # to pull RPM dependencies from the CDN & reposync repositories.
