# The purpose of this script is to wrap yum/dnf invocations that are issued by CI workloads.
# CI workloads needs access to RHEL and ART RPMs when they run, but they do not have direct
# access to the Red Hat CDN or plashets. Instead, their requests must be proxied through
# a content-mirroring service run on build-farms. The content mirror serves RPMs sourced
# from backends like mriror.openshift.com/enterprise and the Red Hat CDN.
# The backends are configured in configuration files like:
#    https://github.com/openshift/release/blob/ca8e034ced5fd4931175774f5eb0ba5b53d1c379/core-services/release-controller/_repos/ocp-4.11-rhel8.repo
# curling the content mirroring service outputs a yum repo file with repositories
# that will cause yum to reach back through the content mirroring service for RPMs.
# See https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GqmPMzeZ0CmVZhdKF_Q_TdRqx_63TIRboO4uvqejPAY/edit#heading=h.qyfinv34w83c for more information.
