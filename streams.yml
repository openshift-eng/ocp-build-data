# If you are about to modify this file, please know that the end result may be changing the
# base images for all upstream CI.
#
# ******IF you are about to bump ART's golang version******
# Please announce to aos-devel/aos-leads before doing so. Tell them when it will occur and
# hold to that schedule so that new CI issues can be correlated with the event.
#
# ******IF you are about to change an upstream_image name******
# Do so only if discussed with your team lead. This field does not impact ART builds.
# When this field is changed, it will open upstream PRs for each image using the stream
# in ART's ocp-build-data. i.e. if you change the upstream_image for golang, you will
# indirectly be responsible for openining >150 upstream PRs.
